# leetcode
## This is a answer collection of leetcode written in Golang. 
If one question support golang, I will try to use golang to solve it. If not, I'll use cpp.  
If there are some problem I can't solve. I'll put some blogs' link in it.  


Almost of the answers is a runnable go file. I have added some basic function and type like `ListNode` && `buildList` and `LinkNode`&&`buildLink` for local test.

~~The answer list is :~~

As Github has changed it's grammar in Markdown(maybe), I can't list the QA and the answer link now. So if you want to search one answer, you can use `CTRL+F` to search the title of the question to get an answer.
